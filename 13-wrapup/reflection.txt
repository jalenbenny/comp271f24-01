I propose a B for my course grade. I was able to watch myself improve in not only understanding but writing java,
being able to draw conclusions based on features in code and grasping and utilizing data structures.
My midterm grade was different from what I am proposing for my final course grade due to some blatant violations of the programmer’s pact, 
mainly excluding documentation or featuring several return statements for one method,
as well as unauthorized imports. However, these issues did not persist post-midterm along with my code compiling, 
which wasn’t always the case in the first half of the semester. This was due to me getting familiarized with the material outside of class,
reviewing some of the O’Reilly material but also external sources (sites like stackoverflow, YouTube videos also helped).
As far as attendance, I was present in every class with the exception of the optional class before Thanksgiving break.
I missed no assignments and was able to see consistency in myself as I got comfortable in my seat and my routine in your class. 
I want to mention that I have a habit of being redundant in code and my efficiency is an issue that I need to address in the future.
I found myself in a strange area between overcompensating in code and not compensating enough, hence my lack of justification for my imports and repetitive methods for our TrainLine projects. 
Right now, I believe this is my biggest issue as a programmer (along with not asking needed questions/engaging when even slightly confused) 
and I was glad to mitigate it towards the end of the course, but there is still room for improvement. It was a learning opportunity-filled experience that I thank you for,
  along with this opportunity to reflect.  (Ben Flowers)
